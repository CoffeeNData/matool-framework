### Matool will bother a bit those nasty WiFi killers

Matool is a MAC address toolkit that will possibly make the process of changing MAC easyer. 
However, this tool was originally developed by me to dodge MAC filtering.
The process of try-and-error was VERY uncomfortable and it drove me insane.

### But no more crying in a corner becouse "daddy doesn't give you internet to play games"!

The MAC filtering testing process is a lot easier with Matool. Really, at least for me.
Since I had problems accessing WiFi network with strong MAC filtering, I knew someday I would end up somehow writing some code to simplify my access to filtered networks.



#### This is still in progress, I will do my best at developping this beautifull child.
