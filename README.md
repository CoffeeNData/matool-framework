# MatooL

### MatooL will bother a bit those nasty WiFi killers

MatooL is a MAC address toolkit that will possibly make the process of changing MAC easier. 
However, this tool was originally developed by me to dodge MAC filtering.
The process of try-and-error was VERY uncomfortable and it drove me insane.

### But no more crying in a corner!

The MAC filtering testing process is a lot easier with Matool. Really, at least for me.
Since I had problems accessing WiFi network with strong MAC filtering, I knew someday I would end up somehow writing some code to simplify my access to filtered networks.

### Important:

I encourage you to post the **bugs** you have found in the `Issues` section.
This will make my work debugging easyer (and will for sure improve your experience).

Do not run this as root, as you will break the notes system. Every root feature will (probably) ask for the sudo password.

Oh! And remember...
## I DONT TAKE ANY RESPONABILITY!

### Have fun ;) !
